    title: StoryBee. A sweet experience.
    desc: Building a brand for a small, local Apiary. We made a special visit to the hives and discussed all thing bees, honey and more. This is the beekeeper, Kristine, at work. Bees are so important and despite all their buzz, visiting the hive, is in fact, a very calming and beautiful experience. I brought my 9 year old son with me and he has a newfound reverence for bees and their amazing world.
