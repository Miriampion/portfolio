{% pattern display/display-2 heading="Bonjour!" text="I believe that design is related to everything we do and how we <strong>feel</strong> about things in the world. From lighting, to landscaping, to type, I am fascinated how all of these can influence behaviors, perceptions and stories. I love learning peoples stories and creating solutions for their brand.
I am a little obsessed with literature, meticulous design, type, gardening, food, recipes and moving lots outdoors. In my spare time, I teach Mossa Group Power at the YMCA/YWCA and I also create things with my 9 year old son.  I am proud to say I coded this site from scratch. I am known for my positive and sparkly personality that I bring to all aspects of my life." image="me.png" %}
