{% pattern display/display-2 heading="Bonjour!" text="I believe that design is related to everything we do and how we feel about things in the world. From lighting, to landscaping, to type, I am fascinated how all of these can influence behaviors, perceptions and stories.
I am a little bit obsessed with painting, literature, type, gardening, food, recipes and moving lots outdoors. I have been drawing and making art things since I was a child and I now draw with my 9 year old son. I am known for my positive and sparkly personality that I bring to all aspects of my life." image="me.png" %}
