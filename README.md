 I am constantly thinking of ways to improve experiences and the design of things around me. I have always been driven to express the creative ideas inside me (otherwise I may explode...) and I like to encourage others to do the same! I believe that design is related to everything we do and how we feel about things in the world. From lighting to landscaping to type, I can not ignore (no matter how hard I try...) how all of these can influence behaviors and perceptions.
I am kinda obsessed with painting, type, gardening, food, books, recipes and moving lots outdoors. I have been drawing and making art things since I was a child. I now draw with my 8 year old son who will probably be a better designer than I am very soon. I am known for my positive and sparkly personality that I bring to all aspects of my life. People say I'm funny too.
