I will always remember the first time I walked into a Starbucks and ordered a coffee, I was blown away. I felt amazing and the whole experience was fun. And that was just for a coffee. I realized in Starbucks how important design is to experience and to feeling. I am constantly thinking of ways to improve experiences and I relish well designed spaces. I know that it is my calling to make the world a more beautiful place and encourage others to do the same!

I am obsessed with painting, type, food, books and moving lots outdoors. I have been drawing and making art things since I was a child. I now draw with my 8 year old son who will probably be a better designer than I am very soon. I am known for my positive and sparkly personality that I bring to all aspects of my life.
