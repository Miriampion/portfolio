 I am constantly thinking of ways to improve experiences. I have always been driven to make the world a more beautiful place and I like to encourage others to do the same! I believe that design is related to everything we do and how we feel about things in the world. From lighting to landscaping to type, I can't ignore how all of these can influence behaviours and perceptions

It is I am obsessed with painting, type, food, books and moving lots outdoors. I have been drawing and making art things since I was a child. I now draw with my 8 year old son who will probably be a better designer than I am very soon. I am known for my positive and sparkly personality that I bring to all aspects of my life.
